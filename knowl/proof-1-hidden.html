We assume that <span class="process-math">\(B,C\)</span> are two row-reduced echelon forms of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> By induction the row-reduced echelon forms <span class="process-math">\(B,C\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> differs only in their <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th column. In other words, the first <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are the same.</div> <div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(B\neq C\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th row of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> will be different from the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th row of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(j\text{.}\)</span> Now if <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is a column vector such that <span class="process-math">\(Bv=0\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(Cv=0\text{,}\)</span> because the solutions of <span class="process-math">\(AX=0\)</span> coincides with solutions of <span class="process-math">\(BX=0\)</span> as well as solutions of  <span class="process-math">\(CX=0\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\((B-C)v=0\text{.}\)</span> Since the first <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(B-C\)</span> are zero, the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th coordinate of <span class="process-math">\((B-C)v\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((b_{jn}-c_{jn})v_n\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(b_{jn}\neq c_{jn}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(v_n=0\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th column of both <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> contains the leading <span class="process-math">\(1\text{;}\)</span> otherwise the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th column of both <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> will become free column and then, we could choose an arbitrary value for <span class="process-math">\(v_n\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Since the first <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are identical the leading <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th column must occur in the first zero row of the row-reduced echelon form of <span class="process-math">\(A^\prime\text{.}\)</span> Since the remaining entries of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th column are all zero we get that <span class="process-math">\(B=C\text{,}\)</span> a contradiction.
