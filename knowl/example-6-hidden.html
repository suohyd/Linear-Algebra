<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"> Let <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> be a ring with unity <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> be a subfield in <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> (we always assume that the unity of a ring and its subring is the same). Then <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a vector space over <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> with the ring multiplication in <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> considered as a scalar multiplication. Note that elements of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> can be considered as scalars as well as vectors.</article></body>
