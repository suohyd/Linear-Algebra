	<title>Natural isomorphism between a vector space and its double dual</title>
	<introduction>
		We describe the <q>natural isomorphism</q> between a vector space and its double dual. The term <q>natural</q> can be defined precisely. However, we will not define this term in this course. We refer the reader to the chapter on Category Theory in the book <sq>Basic Algebra II</sq> by N. Jacobson.
	</introduction>
	<p>
		Throughout this section we assume that <m>V</m> is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field <m>F</m>. Recall from <xref ref="End-vs"/> that the dual space of <m>V</m>, <m>V^*=\Hom_F(V,F)</m> is an vector space over <m>F</m>. The <term>double dual</term> of <m>V</m> is a vector space over <m>F</m> defined by <m>V^{**}=\Hom_F(V^*,F)</m>.
	</p>
	<proposition xml:id="V-simeq-dual">
		<statement>
			Keep notations of this section. There is an <m>F</m>-isomorphism between <m>V</m> and its dual space <m>V^*</m>.
		</statement>
	</proposition>
	<proof>
		<p>
			Let <m>\mathfrak{B}=\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n\}</m> be a basis of <m>V</m> over <m>F</m>. We define <m>v_i^*(v_j)=\delta_{ij}</m>, and extend it linearly over <m>V</m>. Thus, we get a subset <m>\mathfrak{B}^*=\{v_1^*,v_2^*,\ldots,v_n^*\}</m> of <m>V^*</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			We claim that <m>\mathfrak{B}^*</m> is a basis for <m>V^*</m> over <m>F</m>. Let <m>\sum\alpha_iv_i^*=0</m>, i.e., for every <m>v_j</m> we have <me>\sum\alpha_iv_i^*(v_j)=0.</me> Therefore, for every <m>j</m>, we get <m>\alpha_j=0</m>. Hence, <m>\mathfrak{B}^*</m> is <m>F</m>-linearly independent.
		</p>
		<p>
			We now show that <m>\mathfrak{B}^*</m> spans <m>V^*</m>. Let <m>f\in V^*</m> be a linear functional. The map <m>f</m> is determined by its action on <m>v_i</m>. Therefore, <me>f=\sum f(v_i)v_i^*.</me>
		</p>
		An <m>F</m>-isomorphism between <m>V</m> and <m>V^*</m> can now be defined by <me>v_i\mapsto v_i^*.</me>
	</proof>

	<corollary>
		<statement>
			We have <m>\dim_FV=\dim_FV^*</m>.
		</statement>
	</corollary>

	<definition xml:id="dual-basis">
		<statement>
			Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field <m>F</m>. As in the proof of <xref ref="V-simeq-dual"/>, let <m>v_i^*(v_j)=\delta_{ij}</m>. Let <m>\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}</m> be a basis of <m>V</m>. The set <m>\{v_1^*,\ldots,v_n^*\}</m> is called a <term>dual basis</term> for <m>V^*</m> . 

			The set <m>\{v_1^*,\ldots,v_n^*\}</m> is a basis of <m>V^*</m> (refer to the proof of <xref ref="V-simeq-dual"/>).

	</definition>

	<example xml:id="matrix-representation-dual-basis">
		<title>(Matrix representation of dual basis)</title>
		<statement>
			Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field <m>F</m> with an ordered basis <m>\mathfrak{B}=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)</m>. Consider a dual basis <m>\mathfrak{B}^*=(v_1^*,\ldots,v_n^*)</m> as in <xref ref="dual-basis"/>. Let <m>T\colon V\to V</m> be an <m>F</m>-linear map. Suppose that <m>T(v_j)=\sum_i a_{ij}v_i</m>, i.e., <me>[T]_{\mathfrak{B}}=\begin{pmatrix}a_{11}\amp a_{12}\amp\cdots\amp a_{1n}\\a_{21}\amp a_{22}\amp\cdots\amp a_{2n}\\\vdots\amp \vdots\amp\ddots\amp \vdots\\a_{n1}\amp a_{n2}\amp\cdots\amp a_{nn}\\\end{pmatrix}.</me> We have a map
			<me>T^*\colon V^*\to V^*\quad\text{given by}\quad f\mapsto f\circ T.</me>
			We have the following. <me>T^*(v_j^*)(v_k)=v_j^*\circ T(v_k)=v_j^*\left(\sum_i a_{ik}v_i\right)=a_{jk}</me> Hence,
			<me>T^*(v_j^*)=\sum_ka_{jk}v^*_k.</me> The matrix of <m>T^*</m> with respect to <m>\mathfrak{B}^*</m> is the <em>transpose</em> of <m>[T]_{\mathfrak{B}}</m>.
			<me>[T^*]_{\mathfrak{B}^*}=\begin{pmatrix}a_{11}\amp a_{21}\amp\cdots\amp a_{n1}\\a_{12}\amp a_{22}\amp\cdots\amp a_{n2}\\\vdots\amp \vdots\amp\ddots\amp \vdots\\a_{1n}\amp a_{2n}\amp\cdots\amp a_{nn}\\\end{pmatrix}</me>

	<remark>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The isomorphism defined in <xref ref="V-simeq-dual"/> depends on the choice of a basis.
			</p>
			<p>
				Indeed, suppose that <m>V</m> is one-dimensional vector space over a field <m>\R</m>. Consider any nonzero vector <m>v</m>. Then, <m>\{v\}</m> is a basis for <m>V</m>, and its dual basis is <m>\{v^*\}</m>. Similarly, <m>\{2v\}</m> is a basis and <m>\{v^*/2\}</m> is a dual basis. Note that mappings <m>v\mapsto v^*</m> and <m>2v\mapsto v^*/2</m> are different.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</remark>
	<p>We now define an isomorphism between a vector space and its double dual, which is independent of the choice of a basis. We call this isomorphism the <term>canonical isomorphism</term> or <term>natural isomorphism</term>.</p>
	<p>
		We begin with the definition of <term>evaluation map</term>.
	</p>
	<definition xml:id="evaluation-map">
	<statement>
	 Let <m>v\in V</m>. The evaluation map is an <m>F</m>-linear function on <m>V^*</m>: <me>\ev_v\colon V^*\to F\quad\text{is defined by}\quad f\mapsto f(v).</me> We often denote <m>f(v)</m> by <m>\langle v,f\rangle</m>. In this notation the map <m>\varphi^*</m> as defined in <xref ref="contravariant-Hom"/>, will assume the following form.
		<me>\langle v,\varphi^*(f)\rangle=\langle \varphi(v),f\rangle.</me>

	<proposition>
		<statement>
			Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field <m>F</m>. We have the following.
			<ol>
				<!--<li>
					For any nonzero <m>v\in V</m> there exists <m>f\in V^*</m> such that <m>f(v)\neq 0</m>.

		<p>We now prove the following natural isomorphism between a vector space and its double dual.</p>
	<theorem xml:id="canonical-iso-double-dual">
		<statement>
			Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field. The <m>F</m>-linear map <m>\ev\colon V\to V^{**}</m> defined by <me>v\mapsto\ev_v</me>is an <m>F</m>-isomorphism.
		</statement>
	</theorem>
	<proof>
		First verify that the map <m>v\mapsto\ev_v</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear map. Let <m>\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}</m> be a basis for <m>V</m> over <m>F</m>. It is left to the reader to verify that <m>\{\ev_{v_1},\ev_{v_2},\ldots,\ev_{v_n}\}</m> is a dual basis for <m>V^*</m> (follow a similar argument as in the proof of <xref ref="V-simeq-dual"/>). This will prove the theorem.
	</proof>

	<p>
		We obtain the following useful consequence of the <xref ref="canonical-iso-double-dual"/>.
	</p>

	<corollary>
		<statement>
			We keep notations of <xref ref ="canonical-iso-double-dual"/>. If <m>\varphi\in\Hom_F(V^*,F)</m> then there exists a unique vector <m>v\in V</m> such that <me>\varphi=\ev_v</me>.
