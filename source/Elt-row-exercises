<p>Let <m>e\colon M_{n\times n}(F)\to M_{n\times n}(F)</m> be an elementary row operation (of any type).</p>
        <exercise><statement> Let <m>A\in M_{n\times n}(F)</m>. Show that <me>e(I_n)\cdot A=e(A).</me></statement></exercise>

        <exercise><statement>Keep the notations of the above exercise. If we multiply <m>A</m> by <m>e(I_n)</m> on the right, i.e., if we consider the matrix <m>A\cdot e(I_n)</m> then, what matrix one gets? Relate this with "elementary column operations".</statement></exercise>

        <exercise><statement>Keep notations of the above exercise. Compute determinant of <m>e(I_n)</m> for each type of elementary row operations. Is <m>e(I_n)</m> invertible matrix? Justify your answer.</statement></exercise>

        <exercise><statement> Is "row-equivalence" an equivalence relation? </statement></exercise>

        <exercise><statement>Let <m>A,B\in M_{m\times n}(F)</m> be matrices over a field <m>F</m>. Assume that homogeneous systems of linear equations <m>AX=0</m> and <m>BX=0</m> have same solutions. Is it true that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are row-equivalent? [<em>Note that this was a question asked by one of the student.</em>]</statement></exercise>
