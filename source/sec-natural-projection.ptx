		Throughout this section we assume that <m>V</m> is a vector space over a field <m>F</m> and <m>W\leq V</m> a subspace.

		<title>(Natural Projection)</title>
		Let <m>V</m> be a vector space over a field <m>F</m> and <m>W\leq V</m> be a subspace. The map <me>\pi_W\colon V\to V/W</me> given by <me>v\mapsto v+W</me> is called the <term>natural projection</term>.

	<remark>
		It is easy to verify the following.
		<ol>
			<li><m>\pi_W</m> is an <m>F</m>-linear map</li>
			<li><m>\ker(\pi_W)=W</m></li>

		<title>(Correspondence Theorem)</title>
		<statement>
			Let <m>V</m> be a vector space over a field <m>F</m> and <m>W\leq V</m> be a subspace. We have the order preserving (with respect to set inclusion) bijection 
			<me>\big\{\text{subspaces }X\leq V\text{containing }W\big\}\longleftrightarrow\big\{\text{subspaces of }V/W\big\}</me>
		</statement>
	</theorem>
	<proof>
		<p>
			Suppose that <m>\overline{U}</m> is a subspace of <m>V/W</m>. Let <m>X=\{u:u+W\in\overline{U}\}</m>, i.e., <m>X</m> is the set of <em>all</em> coset representatives of <m>\overline{U}</m>. In particular, since <m>0+W=w+W</m> for any <m>w\in W</m>, we get that <m>W\subset X</m>. We claim that <m>X</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>. Indeed, suppose that <m>u_1,u_2\in X</m>, i.e., <m>u_1+W,u_2+W\in\overline{U}</m>. Therefore, for any <m>\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in F</m>, we have <m>(\alpha_1u_1+\alpha_2u_2)+W\in\overline{U}</m> and, by the definition of <m>X</m>, we get that <m>\alpha_1u_1+\alpha_2u_2\in X</m>. Hence, <m>X</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m> containing <m>W</m>.
		</p>
		<p>Now suppose that <m>X</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m> containing <m>W</m>. Consider <me>X/W=\{x+W:x\in X\}.</me> Verify that <m>X/W</m> is a subspace of <m>V/W</m>.
